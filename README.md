# Omission

A game where you find what letter has been removed from a passage.

## Content Notes

The content for this game has been derived from "Bartlett's Familiar Quotations".

For brevity, the source of each quote has been omitted - both title and author.

Many poetic abbreviations, such as "o'er", have been restored to their
non-abbreviated forms for game play reasons. Common modern contractions and
possessives remain generally unchanged.

Sections previously italicized have been replaced with CAPS for easier
display.

Passages have been trimmed and rearranged to be no more than four lines.
