name: omission # you probably want to 'snapcraft register <name>'
version: '1.0rc2' # just for humans, typically '1.2+git' or '1.3.2'
summary: A deceptively simple word puzzle. # 79 char long summary
description: |
  Omission challenges you to put your language detective skills to the test with
  a deceptively simple challenge - Find the missing letter! A famous quotation
  will be displayed, with all the instances of a single letter removed. How fast
  can you figure out the missing letter? It's a race to beat the clock (unless
  you choose another mode) as you try to complete as many passages as you can.
  The faster you answer, the more points you gain.
