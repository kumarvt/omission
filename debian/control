Description: A deceptively simple word puzzle.
 Omission challenges you to put your language detective skills to the test with a deceptively simple challenge - Find the missing letter! It's a race to beat the clock (unless you choose another mode) as you try to complete as many passages as you can. The faster you answer, the more points you gain.
